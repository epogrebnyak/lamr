# Values and operators

## Numbers

> You can use integer and real numbers in Python.

Interger is a whole number like `1`, `2`, `3`, `-5`, `-20` and so on.
They represent counts or quantities, when measured as whole units or items. 

A real number includes a decimal point like `0.33` or `-100.25`.
They can represent a result of some computation or measurement 
that requires fractional precision. Real number are also called  
a floating point number, or a float.

The computer tries its best to store a real number with 
maximum precision, but even then float point arithmetic
can loose some information. 

Numbers can be positive or negative, and can include zero.
