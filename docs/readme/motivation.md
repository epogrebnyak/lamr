# Motivation

On the web you can access [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
or another online course, but as a programmer work a lot with command line.
What if you wanted an early start with command line while learning Python?
`lamr` is a tool you can try for this.

> [!TIP]
> If you are new to command line read into
> [What is the Command Line][ds] in "Data Science at the Command Line" book
> and [Basics section in The Art of Command Line guide][basics].
> [Command Line Basics][odin] of The Odin Project has
> knowledge checklist and good further references.

[ds]: https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/chapter-1-introduction#what-is-the-command-line
[odin]: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-command-line-basics#knowledge-check

Unlike many online courses `lamr` is an open-source Python package.
You can explore its own code and propose changes or enhancements
by [writing an issue on Github](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/bootcamp/issues)
and submitting a pull request.
This way you can practice how to work collaboratively on a Python project
and share something you know with others.

> [!TIP]
> This tutorial [aims to get you started using GitHub][git] and includes
> repositories, branches, commits, issues and pull requests as well as writing a README.
> [Pro Git Book][book] by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub is a bigger reading.
