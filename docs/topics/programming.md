# Basic programming

Everything up until object oriented concepts may count as basic programming:

- data types
- variables
- operators
- input/output
- conditionals
- loops
- functions

Just those features is enough for a language to be Turing complete, i.e. you can technically compute anything that's possible to compute with just those features. Everything beyond that is just learning to use libraries and APIs and learning to write the same programs you could already write but better.
