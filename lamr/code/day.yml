motivation: |
  Handling dates maybe as simple as a string in YYYY-MM-DD format (`"2024-02-18"`) 
  and as complex as astronomic time in [astro.time](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/time/)
  package. 
  
  Be prepared to do simple date and and time calculations 
  and take a deeper dive into [timezones](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/zoneinfo.html)
  when needed. 

excercises:
- Print the date of your birthday.
- Find out what day of the week your actual birthday was.
- How many days left till your birhtday this year? 
- What is your age in day, months, or weeks?
- What is it now in Buenos Aires?
- List time zones for your country. If there is more than one, what is the maximum difference between them?
- Which neibouring country capital has biggest time diference?
- What year is it now? Is this a leap year? How many days does current year have?
- If a payment has to be paid monthly or each 30 days for 2 years from today, what are the payment dates?
- Change output format for today's date using `strftime` formatting.
