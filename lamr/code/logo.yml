questions:
- What is ASCII? What is ASCII art? How could you use it?
- What does `text2art()` function do? What arguments does `text2art()` accept? What is their meaning?
- Each time you run the program the text font changes. Why?
- What is the meaning of the word 'font' in this program? 
- Which of the fonts styles displayed you liked? Why are they appealing?
- If you created you new font style for ASCII art what would it be?

      - Print a logo using these styles.
      - Ask which logo user likes, print the logo that the user selected.
      - If the user is unhappy continue with more logos.
