Interger is a whole number like `1`, `2`, `3`, `-5`, `-20` and so on.
They represent counts or quantities, when measured as whole units or items.

A real number includes a decimal point like `0.33` or `-100.25`.
They can represent a result of some computation or measurement that inbcludes a fraction of a unit.
Real numbers are also called a floating point numbers, or float.

The computer tries its best to store a real number with maximum precision,
but can loose some information due to rounding.

Both integer and real numbers can be positive or negative and include zero.

content = """A variable is an identifier that is used to refer to a specific value
stored in the memory of a computer.
The variable serves as a "nickname", or an "alias", for the value.

The value can be of various types, such as a number, a string, or some other object,
and it can be passed to various parts of the program, modified or reassigned
during the execution of the program.

Concept of a variable in programming is slightly different from mathematics.
In mathematics, a variable is often used to represent an unknown value that needs to be derived by solving an equation.
In programming the variable value is known after assignment and can be used in further computations.
