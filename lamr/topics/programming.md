### Programming as a detective story

Folks new to programming frequently misunderstand the activity of programming. It isn't really about typing code on a computer. That is just the part you do last.

Most programming is really like a detective montage. Where they spread all the photos and documents on the floor and try to "figure out what happened". Well in programming you are trying to figure out:

1. What is the actual problem I'm attempting to solve?
2. What are the terms, data structures and algorithms common to this problem?
3. Is there already a library or program that solves this problem?
4. If no to step 3 then start prototyping your solution.

This is about the time that you learn even more about the problem and then have to start over at step 1.

You cannot write a program for a task you couldn't solve otherwise. So first you learn the problem. Then you devise a solution. Then you translate that to code.

Programming is just a way to record a solution such that a computer can repeat it on behalf of a person.
