README = f"""## bootcamp 
Accessible curriculum in programming and data analysis for non-tech students.

1.  This text is generated by [readme.py](readme.py) and can be downloaded 
as a [JSON file](programming.json). When writing about code, shouldn't this be 
code as well?

2. We can apply skins and themes as frontend to our learning content:
    - [bootcamp.py](bootcamp.py) creates a VitePress website scaffold displayed at 
      [epogrebnyak.github.io/bootcamp](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/bootcamp/). 
    - [slides.py](slides/slides.py) creates markdown that can be converted to HTML 
      presentation with Marp or Slidev.
