Interger is a whole number like `1`, `2`, `3`, `-5`, `-20` and so on.
They represent counts or quantities, when measured as whole units or items. 

A real number includes a decimal point like `0.33` or `-100.25`.
They can represent a result of some computation or measurement that inbcludes a fraction of a unit. 
Real numbers are also called a floating point numbers, or float.

In mathematics, a variable is often used to represent an unknown value that needs to be derived by solving an equation.
In programming the variable value is known after assignment and can be used in further computations.

::: details Assignment operator in other programming languages

To highlight the difference between variable assignment and mathematic equation, 
some other programming languages use  `:=` (Pascal) or `<-` (R) as an assignment operator.

x := 1   // assignment of value 1 to variable x in Pascal 
```

```R
y <- 3   # assignment of value 3 to variable y in R

tldr = "In Python all variables are mutable."
content = """After initially assigning a value to a variable in Python you can reassign

```python 
favourite_food = "My favourite food is mushroom soup."

favourite_food = "Now my favourite food is apple pie."

year = year + 1   # new assignment to variable, not an equation
print(year)       # prints 1992

A typical situation where a variable changes is a counter,
a variable that increases by one at each step.

letter = "m"

title = "Constants and immutability" 
tldr = "In Python variables with UPPERCASE names are assumed to remain unchanged."
content = """Python does not have a concept of **constants** like other languages. 
To indicate a constant the variable name is written with uppercase letters.

```python
LANGUAGE = "Python"

Question: what might be a constant in your program? Explain why this value will not change. 

However, this behavior it is not a syntax rule, but a matter of agreement, or a convention.
Python does not have a built-in mechanism for enforcing this convention at interpreter level. 
This means one can reassign a new value to a variable even if the variable name is written 
in uppercase letters. (This would not be considered a good code practice.)

```python
KM_PER_MILE = 1.6
print("One kilometer is about",  round(1/KM_PER_MILE, 2), "miles")

# ... but I want more precision!
KM_PER_MILE = 1.60934
print("One kilometer is about",  round(1/KM_PER_MILE, 2), "miles")

# Peer advice: define KM_PER_MILE just once and do not change it.
```

Note that some [real code to the similar purpose of calculating distances][geopy] 
avoids using global constants.

::: details Immutability 

In some other programming languages, variables are immutable by default, 
which means that once a value is assigned to a variable, it cannot be changed. 
To store computation results either new variables are created or a variable has to 
declared as mutable when first introduced. 

Mutable variables perhaps allow to start writing quick code.
Immutable variables have their own benefits -- for example, 
they cannot be changed accidentally and the program behavior is more predictable.

title = "Variable naming in Python"
tldr = "Language conventions and common sense guide variable naming."
content = """Variable naming is not as easy at it may first sound. 
While there are just a few formal syntax limitations on variable names,
picking the right name that strikes a balance between brevity
and being well-understood by people who read your code is rather difficult.
Programmers may not agree what makes a good variable name, except for trivial 
cases like `x` and `y` for coordinates on a two-dimensional plaine.

Variable naming ideas from you.com:

> 1. Choosing good variable names is an important part of writing code that is easy to read and understand.

> 2. The name of the variable should be descriptive and accurately describe what the variable holds or what it is used for.

> 3. It should be concise and include only the necessary words to clearly describe the variable. 

> 4. Additionally, it should avoid the use of acronyms and abbreviations that may be confusing or ambiguous. 

> 5. It is also important to avoid using generic terms like "data" or "value" as variable names. 

> 6. Finally, it is important to be consistent with variable naming conventions across the codebase.

Which of the above is the most and least difficult to adhere to? Explain why.
