# Values and operators

## Numbers

> You can use integer and real numbers in Python.

Interger is a whole number like `1`, `2`, `3`, `-5`, `-20` and so on.
They represent counts or quantities, when measured as whole units or items.

A real number includes a decimal point like `0.33` or `-100.25`.
They can represent a result of some computation or measurement that requires fractional precision.
Real numbers are also called a floating point numbers, or float.

The computer tries its best to store a real number with maximum precision,
but even then float point arithmetic can loose some information due to rounding.

Both integer and real numbers can be positive or negative, and can include zero.

### Questions and excercises

1. Provide an example of something that is measured as an integer.

1. Can you think of a border case where it is not clear if the measurement should be done as an integer or a float number.
1. Integer or float: number of taxi rides per day, ride distance, distance travelled on a chessboard, elevator floor, house surface area.

## Arithmetic operators

> Python can work as a simple calculator.
