1.  This text is generated by [readme.py](readme.py) and can be downloaded 
as a [JSON file](programming.json). When writing about code, shouldn't this be 
code as well?  Click a happy counter [👍![][count]][vote] if you like the idea.

2. Now when we've got a JSON we can apply other skins and themes to our learning content:
    - [bootcamp.py](bootcamp.py) creates a VitePress website scaffold displayed at 
      [epogrebnyak.github.io/bootcamp](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/bootcamp/). 
    - [slides.py](slides.py) create presentations that can be converted to HTML 
      with Marp (or Slidev).

3. Current goal is to sync classes in `readme.py`, `bootcamp.py` and `slides.py`
   on balance of simolicity of writing prose in code (eg a topics list) and 
   data processing needs (eg creating a markdown file).
    
## Programming

### P0. Jump Into Programming
> Start learning Python syntax and usage.

* Python Developper Survey: Is learning Python a good bet?
* Python ecosystem: language, libraries, tools.
* Where to run a Python program.
  - Local vs online ([Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [repl.it](https://replit.com/)) installation.
  - Jupyter notebooks vs plain code.
  - Codespaces and Gitpod for Github repositories.
  - PyDiode console <https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html>
* Minimal Python syntax: values and operations.
  - Numbers and arithmetic operations.
  - Strings and operations on strings.Comparison and boolean values.
  - Operators (assignment, arithmetic, comparison, membership).
* Minimal Python syntax: the rest
  - Variables (naming, assignment, mutation).
  - Sequences: lists and tuples.
  - Iteration with `for` loops.
  - Conditional execution with `if`/`else`.
  - Functions and methods.
  - Importing modules and packages.
  - Input and output (console, command line, files and web requests).
* More of basic Python syntax
  - Dictionaries.
  - List comprehensions.
  - `while` loops.
  - Exceptions and `try`/`except` statement.
* Read, talk and ask:
  - Describing what your program does as input, steps and output. Writing pseudocode.
  - Reading documentation: core Python, standard library and popular packages.
  - Search and evaluate: what to expect on first Google page?
  - Asking help right: 'my code doesn't work' vs an [MRE](https://replit.com/).
  - Code generation assistants (Copilot, ChatGPT, and similar).
* Common pitfalls and workarounds at programming start.
* What can you do next
  - Tutorials (and escaping '[tutorial hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qrlx5m/what_exactly_is_tutorial_hell/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)').
  - Toy projects (open-end). Excercises (known result, eg replicate std library function).
  - Finding your itch (a problem to solve).
  - Code practice sites ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com), and similar).
  - Contributing to open source projects.
  - Answering other people's questions.
  - Excercise: what makes a good code problem?


### P1. Designing Programs
> Learn programming concepts.

* Values and types
* Data structures, primitive and compound types
* Variables
* Expressions and statements
* Functions
* OOP and classes


### P2. Project as a Package
> Learn how to distribute your code as a package with modern tools.

* Package managers (pip, poetry and alternatives).
* Virtual environments.
* [Project packaging and utilities](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/).


### P3. Write Better Code

* Can code quality be measured?
* Programming style, patterns and best practices.
* Refactoring: [Beyond PEP8 by Raymond Herringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M), [Refactor Like A Superhero by Alex Bespoyasov](https://github.com/bespoyasov/refactor-like-a-superhero), and [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler (with Kent Beck)](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html).


### P4. Testing

* Excercise: `assert` statement with a function call.
* Aims and types of testing. Unit tests. [JetBrains survey (2021) on testing](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/testing/).
* Unit-testing frameworks ([pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/getting-started.html#create-your-first-test), [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)) and their [popularity](https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2021/#FrameworksLibraries).
* Continious integration (CI).
* Test-driven development (TDD) and ['Where Did It All Go Wrong'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM).


### P5. Docs-as-Code
> Writing and building documentation.

* Excercise: Writing a function docstring.
* [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and lightweight markup languages (rst, asciidoc).
* Excercise: Writing a good README.md - [but how?](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme#articles)
* Documentation and website builders: [sphinx-doc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html)
* Genres of documentation ([text](https://documentation.divio.com/), [video](https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/eu/2017/the-four-kinds-of-documentation-and-why-you-need-to-understand-what-they-are-daniele-procida/)).


### P6. More Python Features

* Type annotations
* Higher-order functions, iteration and lazyness
  - Iterators and generators. `itertools` library.
  - `functools` library: `filter`, `map`, `reduce`
* Flow of execution and behaviours
  - Decorators
  - Context managers
  - Pattern matching
  - Walrus assignent operator
* Data stuctures
  - Dataclasses
  - Enumerations


### P7. Advanced Capabilities

* Asynchronous programming and multithreading
* Metaprogramming (ABC)
* Performance tuning
