It isn&#39;t really about typing code on a computer. That is just the part you do last.</p><p>Most programming is really like a detective montage. Where they spread all the photos and documents on the floor and try to &quot;figure out what happened&quot;. Well in programming you are trying to figure out:</p><ol><li>What is the actual problem I&#39;m attempting to solve?</li><li>What are the terms, data structures and algorithms common to this problem?</li><li>Is there already a library or program that solves this problem?</li><li>If no to step 3 then start prototyping your solution.</li></ol><p>This is about the time that you learn even more about the problem and then have to start over at step 1.</p><p>You cannot write a program for a task you couldn&#39;t solve otherwise. So first you learn the problem. Then you devise a solution. Then you translate that to code.</p><p>Programming is just a way to record a solution such that a computer can repeat it on behalf of a person.</p><h2 id="basic-programming" tabindex="-1">Basic Programming <a class="header-anchor" href="#basic-programming" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Basic Programming&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ar1pbc/comment/kqgo1ah/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Reddit-%23FF4500.svg?style=flat&amp;logo=Reddit&amp;logoColor=white" alt="Reddit"></a></p><p>Everything up until object oriented concepts may count as basic programming:</p><ul><li>data types</li><li>variables</li><li>operators</li><li>input/output</li><li>conditionals</li><li>loops</li><li>functions</li></ul><p>Just those features is enough for a language to be Turing complete, i.e. you can technically compute anything that&#39;s possible to compute with just those features.
